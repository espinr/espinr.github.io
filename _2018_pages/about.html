      <p>This is the third edition of AthTech, a two-day conference that aims at standardising Athletics competition technical management, with a strong focus on data management. <a href="http://www.european-athletics.org/">European Athletics</a> is putting efforts on the homogenization of competition data structures, building a common infrastructure that guarantees data interoperability between all stakeholders: regional/national federations, sports clubs, associations, event organisers, media agencies, and the public in general.</p> 
      
      <p>Read <a href="http://www.european-athletics.org/mm/Document/Corporate/Whatwedo/01/28/28/98/AthTechConference_Minutes_English.pdf">what happened last year</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Objective</h2>

      <blockquote>Shape the future of Athletics</blockquote>

      <p>We will discuss about the European and global requirements of Athletics management systems to implement a standard to collect, process, publish and share Athletics information (athletes, teams, governing bodies, participation in competitions, results, issues and results, etc.). This event will serve as a forum to search for a common solution built on top of the existing local platforms to share Athletics information in a common way.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Topics</h2>

      <p>Competition management data; open data; data visualization; sports statistics; data processing; timekeeping technologies; and whatever related to <strong>technologies + sports</strong>.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Mission</h2>

      <blockquote>Standards for Athletics</blockquote>

      <p>A standard infrastructure for Athletics data management will enable a common mechanism to gain effectiveness and efficiency in the process of collecting and sharing data on a global scale. We will be able to: federate resources in an automatic way; establish universal identifiers for athletes, clubs, and other entities; access better reports; track competition issues, and records; have centralised up-to-date rankings; create and publish live results; create new services and products on top of the data.</p>

      <p>The common Athletics infrastructure follows the open data paradigm, encouraging the publication of data in standard formats and under permissive re-use licenses. This will bring us successful services and innovative products —made by federations or by third parties— that will affect the sport in a positive way.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Audience</h2>

      <p>AthTech is open to anyone. Athletics federations, clubs, and event organisers are invited to present their experiences on competition management (how information is collected during a competition, how entries are registered, how/where results are published, etc.).</p>

      <h2 class="second">Register</h2>

      <p>Although AthTech is a non-for-profit conference, attendees must pay a fee. This will serve to cover the basic logistic costs (i.e., room and coffee). Registration must be performed through the <a href="https://entries.opentrack.run/2018/athtech/">OpenTrack Entry System</a> so all attendees will be treated as athletes who will take part in a competition.</p>
